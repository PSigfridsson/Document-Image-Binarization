# Document-Image-Binarization
Project in Data Science 1DL506 - Project 16
## Project Description
Document image binarization aims to separate the foreground text in a document from the noisy background during the preprocessing stage of document analysis. Document images commonly suffer from various degradations over time, rendering document image binarization a daunting task. Typically, a document image can be heavily degraded due to ink bleed-through, faded ink, wrinkles, stains, missing data, contrast variation, warping effect, and noise due to lighting variation during document scanning. Though document image binarization has been extensively studied, their performance for heavily degraded ancient manuscripts is significantly low. This project will aim at developing document binarization methods, especially tailored for heavily degraded Swedish and Icelandic texts
